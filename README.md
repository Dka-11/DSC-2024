The agricultural industry, particularly apple orchards, faces various challenges in ensuring that every apple harvested is of standard quality. Apple quality can be affected by various factors such as diseases, pests, weather conditions, and maintenance techniques. The manual process of checking apples is often time-consuming and prone to human error. Therefore, a model is needed that can help the apple checking process accurately.

## Evaluation
### Goal
You must predict the quality of each apple in the test set. For each `A_id` in the test set, you must predict the quality of the apple in the `Quality` variable.

---
### Metric
The prediction result is evaluated using `accuracy score`.
